A simple software to help practicing dictation with any language you want

The software is in Brazilian Portuguese, but I'll maybe translate it later to onther languages.

This is a simple webpage that allows you to open videos/audios and use the transcription files (srt) to practice dictation with them. 
If you want to run it you only need to download the three files (html, css, js) and open it in a browser, I only tested in chrome but probably it works with other browsers too.
If you want to open youtube videos with the link, you need to selfhost the website with a server, if you don't do that you'll not be able to open youtube videos with the link, you'll only be able to open local videos/audios.

To use this tool you need to have the video/audio file and also the transcription files (it needs to be srt)

**STEPS FOR OFFLINE USE**
- Clone or download this repository
- Open the index.html file
- click on "Audio/Video"
- Select the kind of media "Audio" or "Video"
- Select the local video/audio file on "Escolher arquivo" and after that click on "Carregar Midia"
- Select the local transcription on "Escolher arquivo" and after that click on "Carregar Transcrição"
- The audio is going to start playing and it's only going to play the first part
- You just need to type what you hear in the field bellow and click to check "Verificar" or show the answer "Mostrar Resposta"
- If you want to go to the next part, click "Pŕoximo trecho" or if you want to go backwards click "Trecho anterior"
- Use `control` to repeat just the part you want as many times as you need to get the answer
